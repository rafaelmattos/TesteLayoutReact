Projeto de Teste para criação de layout e consumo de APi usando React.
Especificação: 
          Crie uma aplicação web React.js
          i) Refaça o front-end como demostrado no modelo disponibilizado em :
          https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z0zXqju6K6Mv0OaAcCqGn1xq9XL-iuem
          ii) Consuma a API encontrada no link:
          https://fakerapi.it/en/?ref=devresourc.es
          *Pode utilizar o recurso Users da API.
          iii) Construa uma pagina com os dados. Para cada resultado construa um card com os
          dados recuperados através da API
          iv) Gere no mínimo 20 registros para ocupar a tela.
          *Não é necessário criar outras paginas ou rotas.
          *No Drive se encontra uma documentação com uma collection do Postman para teste
          caso queira testar a api
          Acessar Postman:
          Pode fazer o download do client ou acesse pelo navegador:
          https://www.postman.com/
          Baixe, entre e faça o Import da collection para testar as rotas.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
